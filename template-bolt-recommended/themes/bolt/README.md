# Customizations

Customizations for the [Bolt](https://github.com/gethyas/bolt) theme go here.

## Usage

Copy the file(s) you'd like to override from `./node_modules/@hyas/bolt/` and paste to `./themes/bolt/`. Make sure to keep the folder structure.

Supported folders are: `archetypes`, `assets`, and `layouts`.

## Mounting settings

If needed, you can change the mountings settings in `./config/_default/module.toml`. See also the Hugo docs: [Module Config: mounts](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/configuration/#module-config-mounts).
